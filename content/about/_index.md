## Who We Are

Sailwave is a technology company built to help small and mid-size businesses compete in the age of AI. We design and deliver intelligent sales operations — from prospecting and pipeline management to full CRM automation — so that growing teams can focus on what matters: building real relationships with their customers.

We believe that the tools transforming enterprise sales should be accessible to every ambitious business, not just those with six-figure software budgets.

## Our Mission

**Help SMEs sail the AI wave.** Sales has changed. Buyers are better informed, attention spans are shorter, and the businesses that win are the ones that move fast with the right data. Our mission is to give small and mid-size teams the same AI-powered edge that large enterprises take for granted — without the complexity, the bloat, or the price tag.

## Why SMEs?

Enterprise software vendors have spent decades building tools for large organisations. The result: CRMs that take months to implement, analytics dashboards nobody reads, and automation workflows that require a dedicated ops team to maintain.

SMEs deserve better. Your sales motion is different. Your budgets are tighter. Your teams wear multiple hats. We build for that reality:

- **Right-sized solutions** that deliver value from week one, not quarter three.
- **AI that learns your business**, not the other way around.
- **Transparent pricing** with no per-seat surprises.

## Our Approach

We combine deep technical capability with a hands-on consulting mindset. Every engagement starts with understanding your current sales process, identifying friction points, and designing a system that fits — not one you have to fit into.

Our stack is built on **Rust** for performance and reliability, deployed through modern CI/CD pipelines, and designed to integrate with the tools you already use. We are opinionated about quality and pragmatic about delivery.

## What Drives Us

We started Sailwave because we saw too many promising businesses stuck with manual processes or drowning in tools that promised automation but delivered configuration. The AI wave is here. Our job is to make sure you ride it — not get swept away by it.
