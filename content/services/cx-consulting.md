## Consulting Overview

We turn customer experience into a growth engine. Together we map the journey, identify churn risks, and design playbooks that make every handoff consistent.

## Engagement Flow

**1. Journey mapping.** We capture the current state across sales, onboarding, and renewal.

**2. Experience design.** We define moments that matter and the metrics that prove value.

**3. Enablement.** We build playbooks, internal training, and reporting so teams execute reliably.

## Deliverables

- Journey map with friction points and opportunities
- CX playbooks for onboarding, adoption, and renewal
- Success metrics dashboard and reporting cadence

## Ideal For

Teams facing churn, inconsistent onboarding, or unclear ownership across the customer lifecycle.
