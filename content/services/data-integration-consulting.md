## Consulting Overview

We align your CRM with finance, product, and support systems so teams work from the same dataset. That means fewer data disputes, faster reporting, and cleaner AI signals.

## Engagement Flow

**1. Source audit.** We map your current data sources, ownership, and quality issues.

**2. Integration blueprint.** We define the data model, sync rules, and governance plan.

**3. Implementation + monitoring.** We build pipelines and deliver monitoring dashboards for ongoing quality.

## Deliverables

- Source inventory + data quality report
- Integration architecture and sync specification
- Monitoring playbook and alerting configuration

## Ideal For
