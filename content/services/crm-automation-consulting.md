## Consulting Overview

CRM automation should feel invisible to your sales team. We audit your current CRM setup, align it with your revenue motion, and implement workflows that keep data clean, tasks routed, and follow-ups consistent.

## Engagement Flow

**1. Discovery sprint.** We review your CRM, workflows, and pipeline hygiene to identify manual friction and missed automation.

**2. Workflow design.** We define triggers, routing, and playbooks aligned to your stages, roles, and SLAs.

**3. Implementation + QA.** We build, test, and document every automation so your team can run confidently.

## Deliverables

- CRM workflow map and automation backlog
- Automated routing, follow-ups, and lifecycle updates
- QA checklist + admin handover documentation

## Ideal For

Teams scaling beyond spreadsheets, consolidating tools, or recovering from CRM sprawl.
