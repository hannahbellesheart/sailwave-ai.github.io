## Stop Selling Around Your Tools

Your sales team did not sign up to update CRM fields, write follow-up reminders, or compile weekly reports. Yet most SME sales reps spend more time on admin than on actual selling. Sales Automation reclaims that time by handling the repetitive work intelligently — so your team can focus on conversations that close deals.

## How It Works

**1. Map your workflow.** We audit your current sales process end-to-end: lead assignment, follow-up cadences, deal updates, handoffs, reporting. Every manual step is a candidate for automation.

**2. Build intelligent workflows.** Using event-driven automation, we create workflows that trigger based on real activity — a prospect opens an email, a deal moves stage, a task goes overdue. No rigid sequences; the system adapts to what actually happens.

**3. Learn and optimise.** Automated workflows collect performance data from day one. Over time, the system identifies which cadences, messages, and timing produce the best results — and adjusts accordingly.

## What You Get

- **Automated follow-up sequences** triggered by prospect behaviour, not arbitrary timers.
- **CRM hygiene automation** that keeps your data clean without manual entry.
- **Intelligent task routing** that assigns the right work to the right rep based on capacity and expertise.
- **Automated reporting** delivered on schedule with the metrics that matter to your business.

## Why It Matters

Every manual task is a tax on your team's selling time and a source of human error. Sales Automation does not just save time — it makes your process more consistent, your data more reliable, and your team more effective. The result: more pipeline coverage with the same headcount.
