## Find the Right Leads, Faster

Most SMEs waste hours sifting through contact lists, LinkedIn profiles, and trade directories hoping to find buyers who actually need what they sell. AI Prospecting changes that. We build machine learning models trained on your existing customer data to identify, score, and prioritise the prospects most likely to convert.

## How It Works

**1. Profile your best customers.** We analyse your closed-won deals to understand what makes a great customer for your business — industry, company size, buying signals, engagement patterns.

**2. Scan and score.** Our models continuously scan available data sources and score new prospects against your ideal customer profile. High-fit leads surface automatically.

**3. Deliver actionable lists.** Scored prospects land directly in your CRM or outreach tool, enriched with context your sales team can use immediately — no manual research required.

## What You Get

- **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) modelling** built from your actual sales data, not generic templates.
- **Automated lead scoring** that improves over time as your model learns from new wins and losses.
- **CRM integration** so qualified prospects flow into your existing pipeline without manual entry.
- **Enriched contact data** including firmographics, technographics, and recent buying signals.

## Why It Matters

Your sales team's time is your most expensive resource. Every hour spent on an unqualified lead is an hour not spent closing a real opportunity. AI Prospecting ensures your team starts every day with a list of high-probability targets — not a spreadsheet of maybes.
